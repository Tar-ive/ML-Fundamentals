# ML-Fundamentals

Welcome to my personal ML-Fundamentals course! This repository contains my journey through learning the fundamentals of machine learning, with a focus on PyTorch and neural networks.

[Live Demo]('https://tar-ive.github.io/ML-Fundamentals/) 

## Course Overview

This course is designed to cover the following key concepts:

1. Matrix multiplication
2. PyTorch basics
3. Tensors
4. Neural Networks (NN)
   - How they learn
   - Why they're powerful

## Progress So Far

I've been exploring various resources to build a strong foundation in machine learning. Here's what I've covered:

1. Studied PyTorch fundamentals using the [Learn PyTorch](https://www.learnpytorch.io/) website.
2. Explored PyTorch's [tensor documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html).
3. Watched educational videos on neural networks and PyTorch:
   - [Neural Networks from Scratch]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?w=XkY2DOUCWMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU))
   - [PyTorch in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORMx45xqWkA)
4. Implemented a neural network from scratch on Kaggle.

## Key Concepts

### Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and forms the basis of many machine learning algorithms. It's essential for understanding how neural networks process data.

### PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides a flexible and efficient framework for building and training neural networks.

### Tensors

Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays and the fundamental data structure in PyTorch. They're similar to NumPy arrays but can be used on GPUs for faster computations.

### Neural Networks

Neural Networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

#### How NNs Learn

Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation, where they adjust their internal parameters (weights and biases) based on the error between their predictions and the actual outcomes.

#### Why NNs are Powerful

Neural networks excel at learning complex patterns in data, making them suitable for a wide range of tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.
